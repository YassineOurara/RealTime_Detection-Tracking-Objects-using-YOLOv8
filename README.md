### Dataset & Annotation
<p align="left">

The dataset comprises 2,822 original images, expanded to 7,545 through augmentation, featuring three categories: bottles, phones, and glasses. These images were sourced from a combination of web pictures and real-world photographs, providing a diverse collection for training and testing purposes.

The dataset has been meticulously annotated using Roboflow to enhance its utility for machine learning applications. Annotations include detailed and accurate labeling of objects within the images, specifically identifying and delineating the positions of bottles, phones, and glasses. The annotations encompass critical information for training models, ensuring precise recognition and localization of objects. This annotation process facilitates the development of robust and effective machine learning models by providing the necessary ground truth data for object detection and classification tasks.</p>

For the prediction step, Google Colab and YOLOv8 were employed to train a robust model on the annotated dataset. Leveraging the power of Google Colab's cloud-based resources, the training process benefitted from accelerated computation, enabling efficient model convergence. YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection framework, was chosen for its effectiveness in real-time detection and high accuracy.

During training, the model learned to recognize and localize objects within images, specifically targeting bottles, phones, and glasses as per the dataset's annotation. The YOLOv8 algorithm, with its object-centric approach, excelled in comprehensively understanding the spatial relationships between objects, contributing to precise predictions.

The utilization of these tools and frameworks underscores a commitment to achieving optimal model performance. The combination of Google Colab's computational resources and YOLOv8's advanced architecture ensures a well-trained model capable of accurate and efficient predictions on new, unseen data.</p>

For the testing phase, OpenCV was employed to assess the model's performance in real-time scenarios. OpenCV, a versatile computer vision library, facilitated the seamless integration of the trained model into live video streams or captured frames. This approach allowed for the evaluation of the model's object detection capabilities in dynamic and real-world environments.

By leveraging OpenCV, the model was applied to a variety of scenarios, enabling the assessment of its responsiveness and accuracy in identifying bottles, phones, and glasses in real-time. This testing methodology provides valuable insights into the model's practical utility and its potential deployment in applications where immediate and accurate object detection is crucial.

The use of OpenCV for real-time testing enhances the practical applicability of the trained model, ensuring its reliability and effectiveness in dynamic, real-world settings.
