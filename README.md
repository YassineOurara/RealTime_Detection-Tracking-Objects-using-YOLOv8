    Dataset
<p align="left">The dataset comprises 2,822 original images, expanded to 7,545 through augmentation, featuring three categories: bottles, phones, and glasses. These images were sourced from a combination of web pictures and real-world photographs, providing a diverse collection for training and testing purposes.</p>    

    Annotation
    
<p align="left">The dataset has been meticulously annotated using Roboflow to enhance its utility for machine learning applications. Annotations include detailed and accurate labeling of objects within the images, specifically identifying and delineating the positions of bottles, phones, and glasses. The annotations encompass critical information for training models, ensuring precise recognition and localization of objects. This annotation process facilitates the development of robust and effective machine learning models by providing the necessary ground truth data for object detection and classification tasks..</p>
